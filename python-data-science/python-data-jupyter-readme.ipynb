    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for taking this course. Its purpose is to show you how you can use Python for data science techniques such as \n",
    "* statistical modeling\n",
    "* data analysis\n",
    "* data visualisation\n",
    "* machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The course aims to build on your existing skills in Python and is **not** meant for beginners. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be exploring some of the most popular Python packages:\n",
    "* NumPy - efficient and fast numerical computing package\n",
    "* matplotlib - most popular library for producing plots and other two-dimensional data visualizations\n",
    "* pandas - provides high-level data structures and functions for work with tabular data\n",

    "## 1.1. Why Python\n",
    "For many people, the Python programming lanugage has strong appeal. Since it first appeared in 1991, Python has become one of the most important programming languages today. Among interpreted languages, for various historical and cultural reasons, Python has developed a large and active scientific computing and data analysis community. In the last 10 years, Python has gone from bleeding-edge and experimental to one of the most important languages for data science machine learning and general software development in academia and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Course structure\n",
    "This is a taught course but the notebooks can also be studied independently. During teaching, you are expected to follow the instructor whilist running all code blocks by yourself. The course is divided into 4 core notebooks:\n",
    "- Notebook 1: Warm-up\n",
    "- Notebook 2: Numpy\n",
    "- Notebook 3: Matplotlib\n",
    "- Notebook 4: Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also additional notebooks starting `python-data-extra`, which introduce new functionality or explore specialised packages for specific data science applications. If time allows we will explore some of these at the end of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Ask\n",
    "*The art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge.*\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Thomas Berger\n",
    "\n",
    "This course should be more of a conversation, therefore do not hesitate to stop the instructors and ask for questions at any time. The demonstrators are there to help you during exercises as well. Furthermore you can also ask other people within the course for help and advice!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4. Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding is all about failure and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you would have to fail several times before making something work but after that you can redo it immediately. That being said, do not be afraid to experiment and fail! Often a useful error message will be printed which will help you solve the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5. After the course\n",
    "These notebooks will stay bound to your account after the course which means that you will be able to finish the exercises in your own free time or even redo a whole notebook if you were uncertain about a particular topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the code we are writing here can be downloaded as generic python scripts which you can run on any other machine independent of Noteable/Jupyther."
