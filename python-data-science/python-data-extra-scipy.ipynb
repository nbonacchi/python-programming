    "The [Power Spectral Density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density) (psd) is a way of estimating how a signal breaks into its component parts. With audio signals, it tells us how we could have built up our original signal by combining certain elementary (sin and cosine) sound waves. It's a bit like trying to \"unmix\" coloured paint to figure out how much red, blue and yellow went into a given colour. The process is quite complicated, so for the purposes of this notebook we will just understand it at this high level: given a signal, the PSD gives us an estimate of its decomposition into elementary waves, which is like a kind of fingerprint unique to that signal. The PSD is related to the Fourier transform, which you may have heard of - in fact, we can use the Fourier transform to estimate PSD.\n",
