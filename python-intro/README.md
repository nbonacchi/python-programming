# Introduction to Python
This Introduction to Python course is aimed at complete beginners. This course is a fork of the [Digital Skills and Training](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/is-skills) initiative from the Information Services of the [University of Edimburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). The original files for the course can be found [here](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/digital_skills/python-intro).  

The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the fundamentals of computer programming and to build your confidence in self-study. For the duration of the course we will be covering general programming concepts and structures which are not exclusive to Python and exist in other programming languages as well.

The course was originally based on jupyter-notebook and has been updated to use Jupyter Lab. All the notebooks will be run and edited using the environment described in the root folder. 

## Structure

### Part 0
Short intro to the Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks / JupyterLab.

### Part 1
Basic programming concepts - variables, types, operations and user interaction.

### Part 2
Higher level data structures, if statements, loops, and functions

### Further Exercises
A compilation of additional exercises covering the previous material.

### Classes/Objects
A notebook introducing classes - a slightly more advanced concept useful for software development.

Part 1 and 2 come with exercises in the end.

It is estimated that the notebooks should take a user an average of 4 hours to complete.

## Next Steps
The core content is contained in Notebooks 0, 1 and 2. The further exercises and material on classes are a great next step.

There is a follow-up course, also part of the , also created by the Digital Skills team, which introduces the tools needed to do data science using Python. It is called Python for Data Science and runs in a similar format to this course. You can find it on event-booking: and the course materials are available through a self-enrol LEARN course, also listed under Self Enrol > IS Skills Courses.
